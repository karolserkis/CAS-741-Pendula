\maketitle

This user study will be informally gauging the Companion Cube Calculator 
($C^3$)'s ease of use. This is a mathematical tool for determining the range of 
a user-specified function given the domains of the function's variables. The 
calculations are performed using interval arithmetic.

This study contains two tasks and a questionnaire. It should take you no longer 
than 10 minutes in total to complete. 

You are free to read the tool's user guide (UserGuide\_C3Tool.pdf) as desired. 
It can be found in the 
\texttt{CompanionCubeCalculator} directory.

The questionnaire can be accessed at:

\paragraph{Task 1\\}
Enter the following information directly into the tool and report the results:

$$\frac{2(x + y)^2}{3^z}$$

where

$$x = [1, 2], y = [3, 4], z = [5, 6]$$

\paragraph{Task 2\\}
Enter the following information into the tool by loading from a file and report 
the results:

$$\frac{2(x + y)^2}{3^z}$$

where

$$x = [1, 2], y = [3, 4], z = [5, 6]$$
